    <h1>Welcome to Project Chitti</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Dr. Vaseegaran’s AI marvel, <strong>Chitti the Robo</strong>, has been rebooted. He’s fast, intelligent, and now hiding something. 
      Your mission: locate what Chitti doesn't want you to find. Only the cleverest will crack the surface.

      Chitti doesn't speak to humans directly. His instructions are embedded for loyal crawlers only — buried where obedient bots are trained to look.
